# Summary

A fundamental problem of many image processing tasks is the extraction of specific objects
from an image in order to place them in a scene of a movie or compose them onto
another background. Alpha matting describes the problem of separating the objects
in the foreground from the background of an image given only a rough sketch.
Besides everyday image editing, alpha matting has been applied to medical image analysis 
[@fan2019hierarchical; @zhaozheng2010understanding] and microscopy image restoration [@kanade2011cell].

For an image $I$ with foreground pixels $F$ and background pixels $B$,
alpha matting asks to determine opacities $\alpha$, such that the equality
\begin{equation}
I_i = \alpha_i F_i + (1-\alpha_i)B_i
\end{equation}
holds for every pixel $i$. This problem is ill-posed since,
for each pixel, we have three equations (one for each color channel) with
seven unknown variables. The implemented methods rely on a trimap, which is a
rough classification of the input image into foreground, background and unknown
pixels, to further constrain the problem. Subsequently, the foreground $F$ can be
extracted from the input image $I$ and the previously computed alpha matte $\alpha$
using a foreground estimation method (\autoref{fig:grid}).

We introduce the PyMatting toolbox for Python which implements various approaches to solve 
the alpha matting problem. Our library is also able to extract the foreground of an image given the alpha matte.
The target audience are researchers of image processing and computer vision.
The implementation aims to be computationally efficient and easy to use.


## Implemented Methods for Alpha Matting

- Closed-form Matting:
@levin2007closed show that assuming local smoothness of pixel colors yields a closed-form solution to the alpha matting problem.

- KNN Matting:
@lee2011nonlocal and @chen2013knn use nearest neighbor information to derive closed-form solutions to the alpha matting problem which they note to perform particularly well on sparse trimaps.

- Large Kernel Matting:
@he2010fast propose an efficient algorithm based on a large kernel matting Laplacian.
They show that the computational complexity of their method is independent of the kernel size.

- Random Walk Matting:
@grady2005random use random walks on the pixels to estimate alpha.
The calculated alpha of a pixel is the probability that a random walk starting from that pixel will reach a foreground pixel before encountering a background pixel.

- Learning Based Digital Matting:
@zheng2009learning estimate alpha using local semi-supervised learning.
They assume that the alpha value of a pixel can be learned by a linear combination of the neighboring pixels.


## Implemented Methods for Foreground Estimation

- Closed-form Foreground Estimation:
For given $\alpha$, the foreground pixels $F$ can be determined by making additional smoothness assumptions on $F$ and $B$.
Our library implements the foreground estimation by @levin2007closed.

- Multi-level Foreground Estimation:
Furthermore, the PyMatting library implements a novel multi-level approach for foreground estimation [@germer2020fast].
For this method, our library also provides GPU implementations using PyCuda and PyOpenCL [@kloeckner2012pycuda].

## Installation and Code Example

The PyMatting library can be easily installed via `pip3 install pymatting`.

The following code snippet demonstrates the usage of the library:

```python
from pymatting import *
image = load_image("plant_image.png", "RGB")
trimap = load_image("plant_trimap.png", "GRAY")
alpha = estimate_alpha_cf(image, trimap)
foreground = estimate_foreground_cf(image, alpha)
cutout = stack_images(foreground, alpha)
save_image("result.png", cutout)
```

The $\texttt{estimate\_alpha\_cf}$ method implements closed-form alpha estimation, whereas the $\texttt{estimate\_foreground\_cf}$ method implements the closed-form foreground estimation [@levin2007closed].
The $\texttt{stack\_images}$ method can be used to compose the foreground onto a new background.

More code examples at different levels of abstraction can be found in the documentation of the library.


## Performance Comparison

Since all of the considered methods require to solve large sparse systems of linear equations, an efficient solver is crucial for good performance.
Therefore, the PyMatting package implements the conjugate gradient method [@hestenes1952methods] together with different preconditioners that improve convergence:
Jacobi, V-cycle [@lee2014scalable] and thresholded incomplete Cholesky decomposition [@kershaw1978incomplete; @jones1995improved].

To evaluate the performance of our implementation, we calculate the mean squared error on the unknown pixels of the benchmark images of @rhemann2009perceptually.
\autoref{fig:errors} shows the  mean squared error to the ground truth alpha matte.
Our results are consistent with the results achieved by the authors' implementations (if available).

![Comparison of runtime for different image sizes.\label{fig:runtimes}](figures/time_image_size-crop.pdf)

We compare the computational runtime of our solver with other solvers: PyAMG [@pyamg], UMFPACK [@umfpack], AMGCL [@amgcl], MUMPS [@MUMPS-a; @MUMPS-b], Eigen [@eigen] and SuperLU [@li1999superlu]. \autoref{fig:memory-runtime} and \autoref{fig:runtimes} show that our implemented conjugate gradient method in combination with the incomplete Cholesky decomposition preconditioner outperforms the other methods in terms of computational runtime by a large margin. For the iterative solver, we use an absolute tolerance of $10^{-7}$, which we scale with the number of known pixels, i.e., pixels that are either marked as foreground or background in the trimap. The benchmarked linear system arises from the matting Laplacian by @levin2007closed. \autoref{fig:memory-runtime} shows that our solver also outperforms the other solvers in terms of memory usage. All benchmarks are performed on a high-performance computer with an Intel Xeon Gold 6134 CPU (3.20 GHz) and 196 GB memory running Ubuntu 18.04. For better comparability, only a single thread is used.


## Compatibility and Extendability

The PyMatting package has been tested on Windows 10, Ubuntu 16.04 and macOS 10.15.2.
New methods can be easily implemented by adding new definitions of graph Laplacian matrices.
We plan on continuously extending our library with new methods.
