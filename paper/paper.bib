    abstract={In this paper, a hierarchical image matting model is proposed to extract blood vessels from fundus images. More specifically, a hierarchical strategy is integrated into the image matting model for blood vessel segmentation. Normally, the matting models require a user specified trimap, which separates the input image into three regions: the foreground, background, and unknown regions. However, creating a user specified trimap is laborious for vessel segmentation tasks. In this paper, we propose a method that first generates trimap automatically by utilizing region features of blood vessels, then applies a hierarchical image matting model to extract the vessel pixels from the unknown regions. The proposed method has low calculation time and outperforms many other state-of-art supervised and unsupervised methods. It achieves a vessel segmentation accuracy of 96.0%, 95.7%, and 95.1% in an average time of 10.72s, 15.74s, and 50.71s on images from three publicly available fundus image datasets DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE_DB1, respectively.},

    abstract={Image segmentation is essential for many automated microscopy image analysis systems. Rather than treating microscopy images as general natural images and rushing into the image processing warehouse for solutions, we propose to study a microscope's optical properties to model its image formation process first using phase contrast microscopy as an exemplar. It turns out that the phase contrast imaging system can be relatively well explained by a linear imaging model. Using this model, we formulate a quadratic optimization function with sparseness and smoothness regularizations to restore the ``authentic'' phase contrast images that directly correspond to specimen's optical path length without phase contrast artifacts such as halo and shade-off. With artifacts removed, high quality segmentation can be achieved by simply thresholding the restored images. The imaging model and restoration method are quantitatively evaluated on two sequences with thousands of cells captured over several days.},

We quantitatively evaluated our system's performance on 16 microscopy image sequences with satisfactory accuracy for biologists' need. We have also developed a public website compatible to the system's local user interface, thereby allowing biologists to conveniently check their experiment progress online.

    abstract={This paper proposes to apply the nonlocal principle to general alpha matting for the simultaneous extraction of multiple image layers; each layer may have disjoint as well as coherent segments typical of foreground mattes in natural image matting. The estimated alphas also satisfy the summation constraint. As in nonlocal matting, our approach does not assume the local color-line model and does not require sophisticated sampling or learning strategies. On the other hand, our matting method generalizes well to any color or feature space in any dimension, any number of alphas and layers at a pixel beyond two, and comes with an arguably simpler implementation, which we have made publicly available. Our matting technique, aptly called KNN matting, capitalizes on the nonlocal principle by using K nearest neighbors (KNN) in matching nonlocal neighborhoods, and contributes a simple and fast algorithm that produces competitive results with sparse user markups. KNN matting has a closed-form solution that can leverage the preconditioned conjugate gradient method to produce an efficient implementation. Experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets indicates that our matting results are comparable to or of higher quality than state-of-the-art methods requiring more involved implementation. In this paper, we take the nonlocal principle beyond alpha estimation and extract overlapping image layers using the same Laplacian framework. Given the alpha value, our closed form solution can be elegantly generalized to solve the multilayer extraction problem. We perform qualitative and quantitative comparisons to demonstrate the accuracy of the extracted image layers.},

    abstract={Interactive digital matting, the process of extracting a foreground object from an image based on limited user input, is an important task in image and video editing. From a computer vision perspective, this task is extremely challenging because it is massively ill-posed - at each pixel we must estimate the foreground and the background colors, as well as the foreground opacity ("alpha matte") from a single color measurement. Current approaches either restrict the estimation to a small part of the image, estimating foreground and background colors based on nearby pixels where they are known, or perform iterative nonlinear estimation by alternating foreground and background color estimation with alpha estimation. In this paper, we present a closed-form solution to natural image matting. We derive a cost function from local smoothness assumptions on foreground and background colors and show that in the resulting expression, it is possible to analytically eliminate the foreground and background colors to obtain a quadratic cost function in alpha. This allows us to find the globally optimal alpha matte by solving a sparse linear system of equations. Furthermore, the closed-form formula allows us to predict the properties of the solution by analyzing the eigenvectors of a sparse matrix, closely related to matrices used in spectral image segmentation algorithms. We show that high-quality mattes for natural images may be obtained from a small amount of user input.},

Our approaches are easy to implement because only some simple matrix operations are needed. They are also extremely accurate because they can efficiently handle the nonlinear local color distributions by incorporating the kernel trick, that are beyond the ability of many previous works. Our approaches can outperform many recent matting methods, as shown by the theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments. The new insights may also inspire several more works.},

    abstract={Image matting is of great importance in both computer vision and graphics applications. Most existing state-of-the-art techniques rely on large sparse matrices such as the matting Laplacian. However, solving these linear systems is often time-consuming, which is unfavored for the user interaction. In this paper, we propose a fast method for high quality matting. We first derive an efficient algorithm to solve a large kernel matting Laplacian. A large kernel propagates information more quickly and may improve the matte quality. To further reduce running time, we also use adaptive kernel sizes by a KD-tree trimap segmentation technique. A variety of experiments show that our algorithm provides high quality results and is 5 to 20 times faster than previous methods.},

There are three key factors for a successful benchmarking system: (a) a challenging, high-quality ground truth test set; (b) an online evaluation repository that is dynamically updated with new results; (c) perceptually motivated error functions. Our new benchmark strives to meet all three criteria. We evaluated several matting methods with our benchmark and show that their performance varies depending on the error function. Also, our challenging test set reveals problems of existing algorithms, not reflected in previously reported results.
