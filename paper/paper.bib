    abstract={This paper proposes to apply the nonlocal principle to general alpha matting for the simultaneous extraction of multiple image layers; each layer may have disjoint as well as coherent segments typical of foreground mattes in natural image matting. The estimated alphas also satisfy the summation constraint. As in nonlocal matting, our approach does not assume the local color-line model and does not require sophisticated sampling or learning strategies. On the other hand, our matting method generalizes well to any color or feature space in any dimension, any number of alphas and layers at a pixel beyond two, and comes with an arguably simpler implementation, which we have made publicly available. Our matting technique, aptly called KNN matting, capitalizes on the nonlocal principle by using K nearest neighbors (KNN) in matching nonlocal neighborhoods, and contributes a simple and fast algorithm that produces competitive results with sparse user markups. KNN matting has a closed-form solution that can leverage the preconditioned conjugate gradient method to produce an efficient implementation. Experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets indicates that our matting results are comparable to or of higher quality than state-of-the-art methods requiring more involved implementation. In this paper, we take the nonlocal principle beyond alpha estimation and extract overlapping image layers using the same Laplacian framework. Given the alpha value, our closed form solution can be elegantly generalized to solve the multilayer extraction problem. We perform qualitative and quantitative comparisons to demonstrate the accuracy of the extracted image layers.},

    abstract={Interactive digital matting, the process of extracting a foreground object from an image based on limited user input, is an important task in image and video editing. From a computer vision perspective, this task is extremely challenging because it is massively ill-posed - at each pixel we must estimate the foreground and the background colors, as well as the foreground opacity ("alpha matte") from a single color measurement. Current approaches either restrict the estimation to a small part of the image, estimating foreground and background colors based on nearby pixels where they are known, or perform iterative nonlinear estimation by alternating foreground and background color estimation with alpha estimation. In this paper, we present a closed-form solution to natural image matting. We derive a cost function from local smoothness assumptions on foreground and background colors and show that in the resulting expression, it is possible to analytically eliminate the foreground and background colors to obtain a quadratic cost function in alpha. This allows us to find the globally optimal alpha matte by solving a sparse linear system of equations. Furthermore, the closed-form formula allows us to predict the properties of the solution by analyzing the eigenvectors of a sparse matrix, closely related to matrices used in spectral image segmentation algorithms. We show that high-quality mattes for natural images may be obtained from a small amount of user input.},

A local learning based approach and a global learning based approach are then produced, to fit better the scribble based matting and the trimap based matting, respectively. Our approaches are easy to implement because only some simple matrix operations are needed. They are also extremely accurate because they can efficiently handle the nonlinear local color distributions by incorporating the kernel trick, that are beyond the ability of many previous works. Our approaches can outperform many recent matting methods, as shown by the theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments. The new insights may also inspire several more works.},

    abstract={Image matting is of great importance in both computer vision and graphics applications. Most existing state-of-the-art techniques rely on large sparse matrices such as the matting Laplacian. However, solving these linear systems is often time-consuming, which is unfavored for the user interaction. In this paper, we propose a fast method for high quality matting. We first derive an efficient algorithm to solve a large kernel matting Laplacian. A large kernel propagates information more quickly and may improve the matte quality. To further reduce running time, we also use adaptive kernel sizes by a KD-tree trimap segmentation technique. A variety of experiments show that our algorithm provides high quality results and is 5 to 20 times faster than previous methods.},

    abstract={The availability of quantitative online benchmarks for low-level vision tasks such as stereo and optical flow has led to significant progress in the respective fields. This paper introduces such a benchmark for image matting. There are three key factors for a successful benchmarking system: (a) a challenging, high-quality ground truth test set; (b) an online evaluation repository that is dynamically updated with new results; (c) perceptually motivated error functions. Our new benchmark strives to meet all three criteria. We evaluated several matting methods with our benchmark and show that their performance varies depending on the error function. Also, our challenging test set reveals problems of existing algorithms, not reflected in previously reported results. We hope that our effort will lead to considerable progress in the field of image matting, and welcome the reader to visit our benchmark at www.aIphamatting.com.},

The key observation is that the nonlocal principle, introduced to denoise images, can be successfully applied to the alpha matte to obtain sparsity in matte representation, and therefore dramatically reduce the number of pixels a user needs to manually label. We show how to avoid making the user provide redundant and unnecessary input, develop a method for clustering the image pixels for the user to label, and a method to perform high-quality matte extraction. We show that this algorithm is therefore faster, easier, and higher quality than state of the art methods.},
